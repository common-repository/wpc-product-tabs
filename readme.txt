Some special products are really in need of this extra product tab to show more convincing reasons for buyers to purchase from your store.

= Highly Customizable Custom Tab Interface =

In creating a new custom tab, users can easily know what they need to do and how the tab will appear in the front-end as it adopts a WYSIWYG editor interface. Even for predefined tabs, users can adjust the order of their appearance by holding and dragging a button to move or edit the title of the tabs to their preferences. All this process is intuitive so there’s no need for complex configurations or any documentation. Users of any levels, whether beginners or experienced ones, can start working on this plugin right after installing and opening the plugin settings.

= Premium: Global Tabs for Selected Products & Individual Tabs =

For Premium users, they are able to customize these tabs at the product level, which means to use different settings for individual products. The individual settings will override the global tab settings when users make adjustments in each product’s tab settings. Specifically, users can add new custom tabs before or after the global ones and even override with a new list of tabs for each product.

Furthermore, Premium users have the “Selected Products” source that allows them to apply global tabs to a hand-picked list of products. Since version 4.0.0, with the user role feature added to custom tab settings, site owners have a better way to control the member-only contents. To create member-only contents, users can use custom tabs and specify the allowed user role(s) for each tab easily under WPClever >> Product Tabs.

What’s best, Premium users can enjoy free customization services on demand to make WPC Product Tabs work well with third-party plugins/themes or match with the design scheme of their site.
